        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Say hello to the BEST veggie burger recipe! Of course, that’s just my opinion, but once you try it, I think you’ll agree. For one, these patties are grill-able! And if you would rather be spending time in the sun than in the kitchen, you can even make them a day or two in advance.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Tamari, balsamic vinegar, and mirin</li>
            <li>Crushed walnuts</li>
            <li>Short grain brown rice, bread crumbs, and ground flaxseed</li>
            <li>Smoked paprika and sriracha</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot and sauté until soft, 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and a generous pinch of salt, and sauté until soft and browned, 6 to 9 minutes, turning down the heat slightly, as needed.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tamari, vinegar, and mirin. Stir, reduce the heat, then add the garlic, smoked paprika, and sriracha. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool slightly.</li>
            <li>In a food processor, combine the sautéed mushrooms, walnuts, flaxseed, brown rice, and ½ cup of the pang. Pulse until just combined. The mixture should hold together when pinched, but it should still have some texture.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a large bowl and fold in the remaining bread.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat, brush with Worcestershire sauce, and serve with desired fixings.</li>
        </ol>
